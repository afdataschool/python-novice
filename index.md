This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python.

It is designed to be used in [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) workshops. Like most Software Carpentry
Python lessons, it references Jupyter Notebooks, but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

> ## Prerequisites
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory)
> and how to start a Python interpreter
> before starting this lesson.
